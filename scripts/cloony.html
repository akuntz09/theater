            george strait fans................?
        <br>george is in his fifties and still hot looking. will he ever look bad?<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>:  george strait fans, if they're truly are fans will always love him.  george strait will always look hot. it's in his genes (and his jeans):) there's just something about country artists and that despite their age they continue to look great even as they get older.  take a look at reba, barbara mandrell, and george strait.  they are all hot and continue to as they get older. i'm sure though that when they're 90 years old they won't be considered sexy, but dolly parton just turned 60 and she looks great and young thanks to surgery; reba just turn 50 and looks 30! george strait just has that quality about him. a honest, country boy is always hot in my book, ans in many other women's. <br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>:  i don't think so... kinda like george cloony lol.<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: QUESTION:
