            what size is your bed and what does your bedding look like?
        <br>i have an old twin bed and i really want to get a queen this year. is bedding for it much more? what size bed to you have and what does your bedspread look like? do you like it?<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>:  i have a twin size bed and it has like 5 blankets on it, the bedding and sheets have dogs on them, they're from "the dog" brand/collection thing. it's really old though. i need new sheets.. :/ but i love the dogs though, i'm gonna miss them if i get rid of them. 

i like the bedding, not the bed. i'm kinda getting a little big for the bed, not that big but i wouldn't mind a new bed. preferably a king bed or full mattress, but a new twin is ok too. i won't tell my dad though since i know how many bills and stuff he has soo.. :3<br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>:  king size bed. maroon and dark purple bedding. i love it!<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: QUESTION:

            do you make the bed when you check out of a hotel room?
        <br>just wondering what some people do. as the bed will be remade by the domestic staff it would appear to be a waste of time, but some people like to leave a room as if it were their own. tell me what you do and why<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>:  i am the domestic staff. i say don"t make the bed. it is going to be ripped apart anyway. it makes it way easier if you leave it alone. we have to put fresh bedding on there no matter how clean you are. and by all means take the little bottles of shampoo, lotion, and soaps. they are there for your convenience. if they are opened we throw them away. the only thing that chokes me is when you use the face clothes to shine your shoes, leave "used socks" in the bed, or half drinks in the trash. <br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>:  just pitch the outer covering across the bed. good enough.<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: QUESTION: 
            was madeleine actually in the bed when other guests checked on the children?
        <br>did they physically see her, or just  peep in the room and listen at the door? will we ever know the true version?<br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>:  don't know but read somewhere they were all put to bed 7pm.for those of you who have children of similar ages to the mcanns, you should all know that not all 3 would settle and go to sleep at the same time in the same room.therefore that leads me to believe that at least 1 or 2 of them would have been awake when the parents went for a meal.and if that being the case then the parents when supposedly checking on them, would have or should have looked in and not listened as stated.but having said all this, the children should not have been left on their own in the first place. <br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>:  no idea - depends on which paper/tv you read/watch<br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: bed!<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: has?<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: lol?<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: u?<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: blanket?<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: pillows?<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: sleep?<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: matress?<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: got?<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: coz?<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: floor?<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: stand?<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: sleep?<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: good?<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: so?<br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: bed?<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: a?<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: on?<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: a?<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: or?<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: on?<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: the?<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: that?<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: a?<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: and?<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: on?<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: it?<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: and?<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: to?<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: on?<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: it?<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: is?<br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: bed?<br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: a<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: matress<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: on<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: a<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: stand<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: or<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: on<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: the<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: floor<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: lol<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: that<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: has<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: a<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: blanket<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: and<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: pillows<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: on<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: it<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: and<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: u<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: got<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: to<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: sleep<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: on<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: it<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: coz<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: sleep<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: is<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: so<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: good<br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: a matress on a stand or on the floor  lol  that has a blanket and pillows on it and u got to sleep on it coz sleep is so good<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: RELATED WORDS!<br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: sexy<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: sex<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: fuck<br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: QUESTION:
