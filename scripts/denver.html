            john denver...?
        <br>what do you think of john denver? i personally love his songs, especially "take me home country roads".<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>:  a very enjoyable singer to enjoy when in a mellow sort of mood.  he died too young, and is missed.<br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: QUESTION: 
            carolina panthers vs denver broncos?
        <br>my take, broncos win, plain and simple.  they are pretty good on the road so far.<br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>:  i hope the broncos win but their run defense is a major concern. they have not been able to stop some of the bad running teams this year and carolina has an awesome 1-2 punch in the backfield. 
i am not as concerned about the broncos run game, as i though tatem bell played fairly well against kc. he just needs to keep the ball off of the ground and not fumble like he did which made him trade-able in his first stint in denver.<br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: denver!<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: more?<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: Starbucks'?<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: Full?<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: The?<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: dispensaries?<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: city?<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: winners?<br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: denver?<br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: with?<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: than?<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: of?<br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: denver?<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: The<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: city<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: with<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: more<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: dispensaries<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: than<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: Starbucks'<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: Full<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: of<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: winners<br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: The city with more dispensaries than Starbucks'.

            agree/disagree:weed should be legalized?
        <br>i agree strongly. 
all of you who think weed is horrible should try it once.  
then i think you have a right to judge..<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>:  i agree strongly as well. the reason why is the following: 

a) part of the attraction to weed is the fact that it is illegal, so more people are going to be inclined to do it because they feel like a "badass" doing it. if weed were to be legalized, like in places such as the netherlands, where people are open about it and nobody has to hide smoking weed, a similar and more open mindset would ensue here.  

b) weed does not affect one's judgment as much as alcohol, and many people enjoy alcohol as a refreshing beverage on a hot summer day.  

c) if you have ever listened to artists such as jimi hendrix or miles davis, you might note that some of their best compositions have been played when stoned out of their minds. weed makes one more creative along with more relaxed.<br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>:  i don't see why it's any worse than alcohol. if you're going to smoke weed, you're going to do it whether it's legal or not. i live in canada and it's not legal but it's not illegal in small doses... but 10 years ago when i was in high school and it was illegal, whoever wanted to do it could easily get as much of it as they wanted. i don't smoke weed so it makes no difference to me but it seems pointless for it to be illegal when i don't think the legal/illegal status effects how many people do it. 

so sure... legalize it.<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: QUESTION:

        <br>my uncle caught me smoking weed. i was pretty stupid the way i got caught. im smarter than that. so, im pretty down right now. because i got a whole lot going for me and i came a long way and my uncle done so much for me that i kinda feel like now that im taking one step back im jeopardizing the rest of my life. i...<br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>:  clearly you're not serious about joining the air force. your priority is smoking weed obviously. that's cool just don't try and kid yourself thinking your gonna join the air force and that niacin is going to magically take the weed out of your system.<br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>:  get more weed and offer it to your uncle. once he gets in to the habit of smoking weed you can smoke together. there is a gazal (urdu poem) sung by gulam ali in which he says god's angles say alcohol drinking is bad. ask them have they ever tested it? (how can they call anything bad when they haven't experienced it?)<br><br>
