            books recommendations ?
        <br>can anyone recommend me a good book 
i like books like twilight, hp books, ttfn, jane eyre, 
i hate books like gossip girl and the clique (crappy books like those) 
yaa..... 
so any suggestions?<br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>:  your book taste sounds almost exactly like mine...so some reccomendations are: 

the gemma doyle trilogy, by libba bray; a great and terrible beauty, rebel angels, &amp; the sweet far thing. 
definitely those. 
also, some that aren't very similar to the books you said, but are really good and i loved them: 
the lovely bones, by alice sebold 
blackbird house/skylight confessions, both my alice hoffman 
the book thief, by markus zusak 
ophelia, by lisa klein 

and, if you're into "deep books," that are thought-provoking and full of symbolism, 
the virgin suicides, by  jeffrey eugenides 

just some suggestions...all some of my favorite books...hope you enjoy :) <br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>:  the green mile by stephen king
