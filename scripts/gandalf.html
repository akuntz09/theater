<b>ACTOR 1</b>: QUESTION: 
            dumbledore vs. gandalf?
        <br>ok, so i've seen some people say gandalf would beat dumbledore in a duel. didn't saruman beat gandalf in a duel once? dumbledore has never been beaten nor will he ever be beaten. voldemort can't even overpower dumbledore!  

what do you guys think?<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>:  gandalf would stupefy that ho! 

but seriously, saruman could defeat gandalf, because at the time of the duel he outranked gandalf in the order of the wizards - white outranks grey.  when gandalf was sent back as gandalf the white he cast out saruman from the order.  even when he was gandalf the grey, he still kicked butt.  he killed a balrog for god's sake!   

dumbledore is basically just a normal human being.  gandalf is an istari, and a maiar meaning that he is divine.  gandalf is basically a lesser god and has had many many many more years of experience.  dumbledore wouldn't have a chance. <br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>:  dumbledore i hate dumbledore but i have to say he would win<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: QUESTION:

            poll: harry potter or lord of the rings?
        <br>i like harry potter but i love the lord of the rings.<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>:  lord of the rings!!! 
lord of the rings is one of the most inspiring stories of all time. the book is a literary masterpiece written by a brilliant man. the characters in lotr have true depth and charm. 
harry potter is pretty good but not great. fun to read and watch but it feels very much watered down and drawn out... i mean how long must we endure before we finally get to the point. 
and for those that say lotr is long... hmmm lets see... lotr = 3 books and three fairly long movies (granted), harry potter = 6 (or is it 7?) very long books and 6 long movies.... hmmm <br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>:  lord of the potters.  
harry rings.<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: QUESTION: 
            harry potter vs. lord of the rings?
        <br>i was just wondering if anyone else loves both these stories to bits and has trouble deciding which one is 'better'. anyone care to share their views?<br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>:  lord of the rings is a classic. the content is more advanced then harry potter but hp is still awesome. i love them both but in my opinion, lotr is just incredible; long but an incredible story of just how much the characters had to go through. it's true, hp is a "lighter" read than lotr and lotr does drag a bit at parts but i still favor lotr. i don't think about reading both again though but the movies i would see again only because the books are just too long. <br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>:  lord of the rings movies are way better but hp books own<br><br>
