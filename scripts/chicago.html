<b>ACTOR 1</b>: QUESTION: 
            dallas @ chicago?
        <br>my pick is for chicago, mainly because i'm not really a cowboys fan. who is your pick for week 3?<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>:  if it were chicago in december, the weather would help the cold-weather bears.  but chicago's offense is not clicking on all cylinders right now. 

chicago's defense held lt and lj to 80 combined rushing yards.  dallas' offense is producing serious points.  but the key is going to be chicago's offense vs. dallas' defense.  can grossman stop turning the ball over &amp; can benson actually score?  i'm not convinced they can (not yet, anyways.) 

my gut tells me dallas wins this in a squeaker. <br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>:  cowboys 20 - bears 17<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: QUESTION: 
            should i move to chicago?
        <br>i live in la so california, and kind of tired of a big city and expensive living. is chicago a cheaper living than la?<br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>:  chicago is cheaper than la. period. i know that from experience. people who say chicago is expensive don't know what they're talking about; sure, it's more expensive than, say, milwaukee. but comparing it to real world-class cities in the us (boston, nyc, sf and la), chicago is by far the cheapest - trust me. i used to pay $1000 for a studio in la in a neighborhood that was "ok." you can get a studio in a much nicer neighborhood in chicago for $600-700. 

(not to mention chicago is much more fun than la, and it has much more of an urban feel to it - la doesn't feel like a city to me; it's just a bunch of freeways clumped together).<br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>:  you must have a better reason than that!<br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: chicago!<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: beautiful?<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: cities?<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: One?<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: most?<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: most?<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: not?<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: US?<br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: chicago?<br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: of?<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: the?<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: if?<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: the?<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: in?<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: the?<br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: chicago?<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: One<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: of<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: the<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: most<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: if<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: not<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: the<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: most<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: beautiful<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: cities<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: in<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: the<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: US<br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: One of the most, if not the most, beautiful cities in the US.<br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: RELATED WORDS!<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: chi-town<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: city<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: new york<br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: QUESTION:
