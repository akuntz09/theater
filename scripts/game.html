            can i have sex....?
        <br>can i have sex when i'm pregnent? because i am 6 months pregnent and i dont know if i can have sex with my husband?<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>:  sex is encouraged unless your doc tells you not to have it, your water breaks, or you have some other complication that can increase your risk of infection. 

sex is healthy during a pregnancy, though, not just for your body, but for the relationship between you and your husband.  sex is meant to bond, and breaking that bond in pregnancy can make the marriage seem like it's on the rocks. 

if you're afraid, ask your doctor, but sex is fine. <br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>:  hmmm, didnt you have sex with your husband last night?<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: QUESTION: 
            sex...when ?
        <br>i'm notplanning on having sex any time soon, but it just got me thinking.. 
is it normal to have sex in college, or should you wait until later?<br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>:  nowadays, it's hard to say when it's "normal" to have sex. the trend, it would seem, is that younger and younger people are becoming sexually active.  

just about half of people, ages 15 to 19, have had sex at least once, here in the united states.   

waiting to have sex is a personal choice, in any case. there's really is no standard age that a person should have sex at. if you choose to have sex while you're in school, or if you choose to wait until later - it's your prerogative. 

if you're interested in stats concerning how many people are sexually active in college, check out the second link in my sources. 

hope that helps.<br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>:  i was 17.<br><br>
