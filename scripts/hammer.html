            van hammer?
        <br>remeber him? if not http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mark_hildre... he was a wcw star. do you think he would have been an ic champion if he came to the wwe? or just another jobber?<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>:  no i don't think van hammer would have had the all-round ability to be an ic champion.compared to jeff hardy, chris jericho and even kofi kingston, he always looked limited and slow in-ring.the fact he never won a title in ten years of pro wrestling says something about his skills imo.to be fair to van hammer though, he wasn't given great gimmicks to work with.the rock guitarist, hippy guy and being major stash in the misfits in action stable did him no favors.i reckon he would have ended up as another jobber. <br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>:  just another jobber.  he would have been used like man mountain rock/ max payne.<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: QUESTION:

you are quite likely to give yourself alcohol poisoning if you drink very heavily though. 
you can also put a vodka bottle to your eye and tip it up to take a slug a-la eyeball paul
