            horse mints?
        <br>can i give a horse just normal candy mints?<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>:  yes! horses love them, especially as a daily/weekly consistant treat. 1 a day is fine, they could probably have more tho. hard peppermint candies are fine, but the softer, fluffy looking ones are the best for them. be very careful tho, if your horse is a fast eater, i wouldnt give him peppermints, because he might eat them fast and forget to chew, resulting in possible choking. horses love them, and they are a great treat! definatly try them sometime if your horse doesn't eat fast! <br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>:  ofcourse you can !!!<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>:  yup, just know that insulin resistant horses won't handle it very well.<br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: QUESTION:

we have to write a simple children's story about the environment and conservation like the lorax by dr. seuss =_= 

um...what the heck are those things in the subject? i have a general idea, but can someone elaborate on it? 

and are there monsoons in the horse latitudes?<br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>:  the horse latitudes are areas where warm relatively dry air descends and therefore there is little precipitation.  in sailing days, the lack of water in these areas would make it necessary for sailors to toss  horses they were transporting overboard. 

since monsoons are very wet subtropical storms, then you would not expect to find one in the horse latitudes. 

the doldrums are in the equatorial region where warm air rises and can leave the seas very calm (even though its where hurricanes are born).  in sailing days the doldrums would trap ships when the winds were too light to get their ships to move. 

the jet stream is an upper level band of wind that on a weather map looks sort of like a river that pushes storm systems around the planet.  in the northern hemisphere the jet stream flows from west to east. <br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: horse!<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: one?<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: know?<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: You're?<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: They?<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: always?<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: best?<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: only?<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: when?<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: one?<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: feel?<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: you?<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: caring?<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: there?<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: animal?<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: does?<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: else?<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: understands?<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: most?<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: can?<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: friend?<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: no?<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: you?<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: out?<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: how?<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: horse?<br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: the?<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: that?<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: be?<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: the?<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: and?<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: horse?<br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: You're<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: best<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: friend<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: the<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: only<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: one<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: that<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: understands<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: you<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: when<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: no<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: one<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: else<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: does<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: They<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: can<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: be<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: the<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: most<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: caring<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: animal<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: out<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: there<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: and<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: always<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: know<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: how<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: you<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: feel<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: You're best friend, the only one that understands you when no one else does.
