            sex problems?
        <br>im 17 i want to have sex with my boyfriend for the first time. but i dont kno anything about sex waht is sex what are good techniqes help!<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>:  sex is something that just comes naturally. relax and take it slow and find out what each of you like. make sure he is as ready as you are for sex. use protection. it may be your first time, but it might not be his. protect yourself from an unwanted pregnancy. be romantic and enjoy the feeling you have being close to someone you love, and you don't have to have sex to do that.<br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>:  little girl, read you a darn book or something. you are too young to be wanting to have sex. this is ridiculous, i'm so tired of seeing you young folks on here talking about having sex. where are your damn parents?<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: QUESTION: 
            can i have sex....?
        <br>can i have sex when i'm pregnent? because i am 6 months pregnent and i dont know if i can have sex with my husband?<br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>:  sex is perfectly safe during pregnancy, and actually healthy for you as long as you don't over do it. "first on this list is sex.  sex during pregnancy is rarely discussed, even though it should be.  the changes in your body are great and affect every area of y our life, including your sex life.  you will be more tired than usual, sore, and moody.  however, some women experience a high level of sexual desire during pregnancy, and then some experience a sexual level that is lower than their norm.  this is an issue that should also be discussed with your partner." from the preggie book i am in the process of writting, i will be posting parts of it on my blog if you wanna check it out at:(http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fus... in my book i discuss many things that doctors neglect to cover with expectant mothers. hope some of that info is helpful!)<br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>:  sex is encouraged unless your doc tells you not to have it, your water breaks, or you have some other complication that can increase your risk of infection. 

sex is healthy during a pregnancy, though, not just for your body, but for the relationship between you and your husband.  sex is meant to bond, and breaking that bond in pregnancy can make the marriage seem like it's on the rocks. 

if you're afraid, ask your doctor, but sex is fine. <br><br>
