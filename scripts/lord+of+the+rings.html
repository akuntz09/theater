            did tolkien write a sequel to lotr?
        <br>i never read the books but according to what i heard and what the movie suggest is that sam will have his own adventure. 
did tolkien ever write a book with sam as protagonist ? 


sorry for my english, english grammar is hard...<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>:  as far as i know the only other book outside of the hobbit and the trilogy is the simarilian (sp?) 

tolkien hadnt finished it at the time of his death, it was later finished and published by his son. 

it is less a story and more a book of lore, explaining much of the world in which his stories are set.<br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>:  no, but he must have put it somewhere in that appendix.<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: QUESTION:
