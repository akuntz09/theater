            is shakira white?
        <br>is the colombian singer white? she has light skin and looks white<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>:  yes, shakira is white. people born in latin america are not considered white in united states even if they are very white. if britney spears was born in colombia, everyone would consider her latina instead of white.... 

so shakira is white, just because americans don't consider her white doesn't mean she is not. 

and colombian is not a race, it's a nationality,  there are many whites in colombia. <br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>:  she is white hispanic<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: QUESTION: 
            could you prove that black is white?
        <br>same thing for could you prove white is black? help me clear this up!<br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>:  scientifically, no.  black occurs when all light is absorbed.  white occurs when all light is reflected. 

racially, scientifically yes.  there is only one race of people in the world, the human race. 

philosophically, the yin/yang new age people think they have, but i don't agree. (good and evil are two sides of the same coin type thing). 

but in court, a lawyer can prove anything he can get a jury or the judge to believe.  doesn't mean it's true, though. 

hope that helps.  hey, ho, for conundrums.<br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>:  extremely tough problem query over yahoo just that might help<br><br>
