            alternative fuel...burn tree huggers?
        <br>remember... its only a question, not my opinion!<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>:  tree huggers like all human beings are a poor source of fuel.  humans have such a high water content that to burn them actually requires a net loss in energy.  in other words, you'll spend more in energy burning the humans than you will get out of the burning of humans. 

even when broken down to constituent elements, most of them are not flammable or energy producing as fuel. 

you just can't make the process efficient enough to make it worthwhile. 

i don't take this question too seriously.  i just thought of it as a good exercise in thinking outside the box. <br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>:  i agree with andrew o - humans are a poor energy source.<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: QUESTION: 
            is avatar a tree hugger movie?
        <br>i want to see it, but i don't want to sit through two hours of environmental lectures and propaganda.<br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>:  i've seen it twice and it's not that bad (and i'm definitely not a tree-hugger). there is certainly an agenda in the plot line, but not so bad that you can't still enjoy the movie. the special effects are phenomenal. just turn off your b/s filter and go. go to the 3-d version if at all possible!!! 

edit: 

i have to disagree with one of your other answers. it definitely has an anti-military sub-plot. true, there are good military people in the movie, but they are the minority fighting against the much bigger environment destroying, bigoted military machine. the writers of the movie did not have to go down that road. it was obviously another agenda issue. <br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>:  yeah, but it's still worth seeing even if the message has been said before.<br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: tree!<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: Weed?<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: slang?<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: Pot?<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: Poht?<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: A?<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: etc?<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: Grass?<br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: tree?<br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: for?<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: tree?<br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: A<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: slang<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: for<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: Weed<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: Pot<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: Poht<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: Grass<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: etc<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: A slang for  Weed, Pot, Poht, Grass, etc.<br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: RELATED WORDS!<br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: weed<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: trees<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: bud<br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: QUESTION: 
            agree/disagree:weed should be legalized?
        <br>i agree strongly. 
all of you who think weed is horrible should try it once.  
then i think you have a right to judge..<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>:  i agree strongly as well. the reason why is the following: 

a) part of the attraction to weed is the fact that it is illegal, so more people are going to be inclined to do it because they feel like a "badass" doing it. if weed were to be legalized, like in places such as the netherlands, where people are open about it and nobody has to hide smoking weed, a similar and more open mindset would ensue here.  

b) weed does not affect one's judgment as much as alcohol, and many people enjoy alcohol as a refreshing beverage on a hot summer day.  

c) if you have ever listened to artists such as jimi hendrix or miles davis, you might note that some of their best compositions have been played when stoned out of their minds. weed makes one more creative along with more relaxed.<br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>:  not when driving. it slows down your reaction time.<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: QUESTION:
