            anime with best fights?
        <br>i liked the fights in fmab, naruto, bleach and basilisk<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>:  naruto - has good fighting sequences and the fights are not short. 
sword of a stranger - has the best sword fight i've ever seen. 
samurai shamploo - mugen is fricking badass and is wild and strong and the fights are insane. (only problem is the plot is nonexistent) 
gintama - yeahh fights are rare in this one because the main is a slacker and is more comedy oriented but gintoki is a beast when he gets serious. 
darker than black - hei is one of the most intriguing anime characters, he is badass and smart which means that he is deadly. <br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>:  soul eater has one of the best animations.... hunter x hunter is good too<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: QUESTION:

            anyone want an argument..?
        <br>are you looking for an argument.. 
well make my day...<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>:  i am! what have you got? i want you to make my day. i can argue anything with you and probably be right a lot more than you.  
you come asking for an arguement, now we'll have one. 
you're not as brave as you say you are, are you? 
and that horse.. it doesn't even know not to eat laptops and get drunk!  
you two are a perfect match!<br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>:  yes. if we both agree then there can be no argument .<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: QUESTION: 
            please give me a short definition of a valid argument?
        <br>please give me a short definition of a valid argument<br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>:  a valid argument is something someone says that could be true, because the claim is logical and makes sense, basically.  

all cats are dogs. 
all dogs are mice. 
therefore, all cats are mice. 

now, we all know this isn't true, but if you look at it through your logic, it would be a valid argument. valid arguments just have to make sense, they don't have to be true. 

sorry, i know it's not a short definition like you asked for, but if people just give you a short definition, you'll never get it. i had a hard time with this argument stuff myself.<br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>:  a valid argument is one in which the premise makes the conclusion true.<br><br>
