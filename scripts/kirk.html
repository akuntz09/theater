            metallica and kirk hammett?
        <br>why does every procced to say that kirk hammett sucks. alot of people compare him to dave cause kirk took dave job , yes dave is better imo but kirk holds his spot respectally as a good guitarist. his solos have great melodies and are very tame. so why does everyone say he sucks? do people have something against...<br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>:  kirk hammett is an amazing guitarist dave mustaine is just better<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>:  he is good but he is just overrated.<br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>:  kirk hammett is a concrete foundation in metallica now.  

his playing, in particular his solo's, and his style are tight and flawless.  

inculding james who is arguably one of the greatest rhythm guitarists.  

they work together brilliantly, and i wouldn't have metallica any other way.<br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: kirk!<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: flip?<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: out?<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: out?<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: wig?<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: go?<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: crazy?<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: To?<br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: kirk?<br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: to?<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: to?<br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: kirk?<br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: To<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: go<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: crazy<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: to<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: flip<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: out<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: to<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: wig<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: out<br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: To go crazy, to flip out, to wig out.<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: RELATED WORDS!<br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: trek<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: shatner<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: kirked<br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: QUESTION: 
            are atheists like spock?
        <br>he buries his emotions and thinks purely logically, he acts like he lacks feelings and doesn't care about anything or anyone.  

this is what the human race would be like if they didn't have souls... since most atheists try to bury their souls do they strive to act like spock?<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>:  you need a broader sample. try this list of celebrity atheists:

            in star trek, why is spock so critical of the human race so much?
        <br>he and kirk are best friends, but he still insults the human race in the episode (mirror, mirror) and (patterns of force). why is that?<br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>:  spock is half-human, and that's been a sore point his entire life.  in some ways, he resents his human half and his criticisms about humanity could be seen as a reflection of that. 

at the same time, i think spock secretly enjoys annoying mccoy and says things to specifically to get his goat.   

finally, it's the writers using spock as a mouthpiece for whatever bits of philosophy the want to leave the audience with about the themes of the episode. <br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>:  cause his race has tiny gentiles<br><br>
