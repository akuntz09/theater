            girls, would you ever date a nerd?
        <br>well, not your typical nerd. just think of a really smart guy who likes to study but also spend a lot of time at he gym. i guess you can call him a nerdy gym rat.<br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>:  nerds are...complicated. but then, who isn't? 

would i date a nerd? totally. nerds have a way of understanding the need for 'space' and are almost always a safe play with parents. parents have a tendency to love them. but 'nerd' can mean a lot of things - i'm going to assume that you mean he's a smart guy who's into sci-fi and books. smart guys are always the way to go. always. brain over brawn in a relationship, for sure. 

the one reason not to love nerds (who are, generally speaking, adorable) is that, stereotypically, they're out of shape and like to hole themselves up in their bat caves. if you say yours is a gym rat then... i'd totally go for it. for sure. <br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>:  yeh nerds r awesome i  luuuvv nerds!<br><br>
