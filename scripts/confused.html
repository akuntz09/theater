            guys.............. im confused......?
        <br>i am sooooo confused.... i really like this guy and we hang out all the time. and we hug wen c each other and i just started thinkin that he likes me.........then his friend said he likes another chick. but i dnt get it, we r great friends and i feel a strong connection and he is always flirting with me.......wat...<br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>:  ok, listen up. guys are very simple people, they like flirting and always want something new. his friend could of told you that, to get out of you that you liked his friend. to be honest you should just let him know how you feel, i know that sounds hard but in the end you'll see it was worth it. don't worry about being turned down, you only have one life, live it to the fullest... 
good luck!<br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>:  maybe he dose like you but he does not want to ruin your relationship with you because once you do go out with someone and it does not work your friendship is ruin so he might like you but doesn't want anything to be sacrificed in the end of this<br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: QUESTION:

            confused?! help!?
        <br>at the moment i'm a bit confused as to what my sexuality is. i am not aroused at all by any types of porn. i don't get hard over thinking about anything to do with guys (gay kissing, gay sex etc.  but i dont seem to ever check out women or notice how they look, but i seem to always notice how guys look, but...<br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>:  well, porn doesn't count for much- most of it is pretty poorly made because, really, who is going to write a letter damanding better acting? 
i'd say that, for the time being, you have a low sex drive and as long as you're not trying to get into a relationship, it doesn't mater. you may find that, while women are sexually interesting, you find you have a better emotional bond with men. or whatever- you're questioning, but don't sweat it.<br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>:  sounds pretty damn straight to me. :d 

which is funny, because i have -never- met a straight guy named ryan. really. i must know four. and i think i laughed like crazy when i watched high school musical. i think it has something to do with the name. but whatever, that's not important. it's normal to notice people, but if you don't feel sexually attracted to them, then, yeah, that's straight.<br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: confused!<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: when?<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: know?<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: relationship?<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: they?<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: word?<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: there?<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: often?<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: relation?<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: women?<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: ship?<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: don't?<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: most?<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: how?<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: men?<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: going?<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: used?<br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: confused?<br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: the?<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: that?<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: is?<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: by?<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: and?<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: a?<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: is?<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: or?<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: if?<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: is?<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: a?<br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: confused?<br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: the<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: word<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: that<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: is<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: most<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: often<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: used<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: by<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: women<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: and<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: men<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: when<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: they<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: don't<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: know<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: how<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: a<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: relationship<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: is<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: going<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: or<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: if<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: there<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: is<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: a<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: relation<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: ship<br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: the word that is most often used by women and men when they don't know how a relationship is going, or if there is a relation ship.<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: RELATED WORDS!<br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: weird<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: confuzzled<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: stupid<br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: QUESTION:

            is this weird...?
        <br>is it weird that i subconsiously start sucking on my left index finger everytime i get turned on?<br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>:  it would b better if u buy a suckling nipple and suck it when u have sex...<br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>:  yeah, it is a little weird that you do it when you get turned on, but your not alone. a lot of people have weird little habits like sucking their thumb, biting their nails etc. people do this when they are deep in thought, nervous or tired and as i just learned: aroused....if it comes to you naturally then call it nature!! <br><br>
