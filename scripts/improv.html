            is improv an artform?
        <br>i concerder stand-up comedy peroformance art. i feel the same way about improv. really good improv, that is, which can be hard to find. what are your thoughts and have you've ever seen a show that was truely amazing?<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>:  brutal question, almost.  

by definition, improv fits into the post-modern school along with elements of satire and humor. it began in the late 50's with miles davis in jazz music and the same is true with improv in dance and theater. 

improv on one level is simply a tool to generate material that will later by shaped into a work. i think that many find that the doing of improv is so much fun that they want to take it to the stage ~ which can be incredible and can also appear indulgent and narcissistic. since it is, indeed, improvised one takes chances whether any given night will be any good needing both the performer and the audience to be receptive and willing to connect.  

in the context of performance art - i have no problem at all thinking of improv as an art form. <br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>:  i say yes..<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: QUESTION:

        <br>what is music to you? 


music is my life.<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>:  music is my life. i listen to it at least 1 hour a day. i'm into all genres. these days i mainly listen to heavy metal music. i think a lot of the music today is garbage because people focus more on their looks than they do on their music. <br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>:  music is musical?<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: QUESTION: 
            skating music suggestions?
        <br>i need music suggestions for an adult silver competition piece.  i like classical music or dramatic music. 

thanks!<br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>:  every once in a while, you come across music that should be skated to by someone.  have you ever heard the "waltz from carousel?"  it's a little hard to find the soundtrack for the musical/movie "carousel" but you can find that song on compilation cd's.  i've included a listening link below, but the whole piece has a lot of variation in tempo and intensity. 

the entire song is pretty long, so you'll need to cut it to the 2m10s length you need for adult silver.<br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>:  there are soo many to choose from you should look online.<br><br>
