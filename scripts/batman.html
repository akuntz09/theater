            why does batman drive a car?
        <br>when he can fly on his own.<br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>:  cuz the creator thought that bruce needed 2 be more realistic in physical elements<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>:  because robin has dibs on the motorcycle duh<br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>:  batman cannot fly unless he's in a plane. 

where did you get that idea? 

unlike spider-man, batman has nothing to do with bats other than having the theme of the costume.  he has absolutely no super-powers. 

the only batman that can actually fly is the one in batman beyond, who uses a jet-powered suit.<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: QUESTION:
