            how to become a happy person ?
        <br>i want to become happy all the time<br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>:  it is impossible to become "happy all the time".  you can have a deep foundation of contentment with who you are and your life, but things happen and it will eventually make you unhappy if you are human and don't have a personality disorder. 

remember it is the differences in life that makes us appreciate them.  without hard work, there is no pride in work done.  we are often reminded of why we should be happy by being shown horrible sorrow.   

the single greatest thing that has made me happy is focusing on what i appreciate, from fresh air on a spring day to a stranger returning my smile, to realizing you are healthy and going for a walk to prove it!  there is so much to be grateful for, and most of it's free so enjoy it!<br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>:  the law of attraction. think positive happy thoughts always<br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: happy!<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: contentment?<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: anything?<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: A?<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: need?<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: don't?<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: feeling?<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: you?<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: else?<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: peace?<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: like?<br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: happy?<br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: of?<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: and?<br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: happy?<br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: A<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: feeling<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: of<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: contentment<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: and<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: peace<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: like<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: you<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: don't<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: need<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: anything<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: else<br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: A feeling of contentment and peace, like you don't need anything else.<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: RELATED WORDS!<br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: happiness<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: sad<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: sex<br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: QUESTION:

my ex-wife really did me wrong for many years so i had no reservations about leaving her or about having hidden intentions to leave her. i warned her about it for years. she was using me for my income and i made her feel safe. she cheated, lied, was violent... etc etc etc...  

what i have now is priceless... never been happier.  

what was your price for happiness?<br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>:  .great question.  

my price for peace?  anything that keeps me with a clear conscience.<br><br>
