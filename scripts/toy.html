            what is the best dog toy?
        <br>occasionally i will buy a toy for my dog although she can get fed up of them quite quickly, i was wondering what the best and most exciting dog toy was and i will see if she likes it, or whether she just prefers walks.
[she doesn't particularly like playing fetch with anything, but prefers stealing whatever it...<br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>:  toys should never replace a walk even if a dog prefers the toys...walking keeps a dog healthy and mentally stimulated.walking fulfills a dogs natural instincts,nothing can replace that...keep walking her even if she loves whatever new toy you get her. 

my dogs do like fetch but i find that a kong with peanut butter keeps them busy...but they don't get them all the time.they usually just end up liking things that aren't actual toys...like socks or something. 

my dogs like the freezer dog bones...another good idea.

try rotating her toys so she doesn't have them all at once and wont get bored with them...i change the toys every few days. 

maybe take her to the pet store and see what attracts her...it may be sound,smell, or feel...she may like a hard rubber or a soft plush toy. <br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>:  there is a pack sold by costco for under $20 and it is amazing! both of my dogs love it! one is a small 3 month old lab puppy and the other is a larger pit bull mix... it is basically a toy that comes with treats that are just the right size and they have to roll it around to get the treats out. the toy is called tricky treats ball. my dogs love it!!! seriously, before when we were at work they would get into the garbage and now it keeps them entertained for 6-8 hours. they also cannot get enough of the treats and get excited every time i grab the bag. i highly recommend it!

            my little niece only wants to play with boys toys!?
        <br>my sister is really concerned about this. my 8 year old niece only plays with boys toys and would throw a fit if she recieved a doll as a gift. instead she wants to play with action figures, train sets, remote control cars, toy guns and all the other kinds of toys that are mainly for boys. my sister has adviced me...<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>:  hi hunny,  
i havent got any children of my own but i have had loads of experience with children who do this both on a professional and personal level. most children do it at a younger age, but it is perfectly normal for girls to want to play with boys toys and vice versa, when i worked in a nursery we didnt encourage that play but we supported it, sometimes it may just be due to her surroundings, like for example is she surrounded by a few boys? i hope this helps, but honestly there is nothing to worry about :) all the best xx<br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>:  what the heck is wrong with this?  why do you want to mold this child to your expectations?  leave her alone to play with the toys she enjoys. 
who decided that toys have gender anyway?  what gender is a ball, or a bike?  it's rediculous.  i loathe this kind of thing. 

you are trying to condition her.  let her be who she is or she will rebel.<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: QUESTION: 
            what is your definition of 'boy toy?'?
        <br>i was recently referred to by this title jokingly (perhaps).  i know it mean slightly different things to different people.  do you feel as though it refers to a casual intimate relationship or that it refers to a relationship in which the woman is older and possibly successful and is merely looking for an...<br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>:  "this can mean many things.  
for some girls a boy toy is someone who they take advantage of for sexual purposes. in most cases, a boy toy is someone they fool around with, or like to be around. in this use of the word, both the female and the male have equal power. so, contrary to what some people think, being this does not make you somebody's *****. being a boy toy is not a bad thing, it is mostly a good thing especially for guys who are horndogs. but everyone always knows that girls have a little more power because they can take away privelages. so don't complain :]"

            anal sex????
        <br>i did it with my husband when we were dating. now we are marrie,i even ask him for it one time.but i just don't want to do it any more, i decide is not for me and now he won't stop asking me for more and telling me that we should do it because we done it before. i don't want to do it and i don't...<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>:  state it simply. no, honey, i'm not into that. forget that i did it a few times, i just really don't like it. 

i don't care for it either and my hubby likes to tease me about it and i just make it clear that it's nothing personal, but i don't wanna do that!  

it compares to having a bowel movement- now what's romantic or sexual about that! tell him if he loves you he'd understand.  

i don't like to hear that "you would if you loved me" stuff. glad my hubby respects my decision. i hope yours will too.<br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>:  what an obnoxious and immature guilt trip. you have every right to refuse it, and he needs to respect your decision. ignore the guilt trip that you "don't love him" because you won't let him poke you in the behind. make it firm and definite. 

or you could try this. get a hold of a large, imposing looking dildo, and say that you'll give it up if he lets you use it on his backdoor.<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: QUESTION: 
            whats with guys &amp; anal sex?
        <br>i was watching a tv show about girls &amp; guys fantasies the other day, &amp; 46% percent of males said they would love to perform anal sex on their girlfriend/wives. i'm left wondering, why? how is that pleasurable for the women? i've had friends who have had really bad experiences -- which has made me stay far...<br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>:  i'm not a guy so i suppose i can't really explain from a guy's point of view, but from what i know it's because people want what they can't have. sexually, it feels really good for a guy to penetrate a "tight" spot, and the rectum is as tight as it gets. for girls it's painful because the rectum doesn't produce any natural lubrication, so it's very rough business. 
many girls, when done right, love the feel of anal sex, some preferring it even over vaginal sex. there are lots of sensitive nerves in and around the rectum that cause pleasure and it's even possible to orgasm from anal sex. again, for men, the "tight" feeling is what intrigues them, and also probably because it's something new to try and explore. 

and it's not a silly question, what's wrong with being curious, especially on such a platform as yahoo answers? there are no silly questions, only silly answers.<br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>:  this guy was trying to finger my anus, and he pressed against my anus and was gonna push in (another time when we were in the heat of things in doggy), and i had to say like "hey what're you doing?" it grosses me out! i'm sorry but it grosses me out i'm a medical student and that is so unhygienic! 

but a guy friend of mine said that guys may like it because it is so taboo and forbidden 

i don't know. i think i'd hate it.<br><br>
