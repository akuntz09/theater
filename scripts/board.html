that's all a ouija board is! 

the ouija board was created so spiritualists and other fake mediums could show how the dead were supposed to communicate with them. there is nothing inherently evil about a ouija board, just that some dishonest people use them. 

if you wish to try it out, place center piece over the board and let your self conscious guide your hand to a letter on the board. continue this process until you spell a word or have an answer to your question. this process takes a long time and is more complicated than just laying down and thinking about your question. maybe that's one reason why the ouija board never became popular outside the spiritualist world. <br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>:  the real one needs no batteries, duh, toss away that crap.<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: QUESTION:

i tried out risk (newest version) a couple times, and i really didn't like it. it was so luck-based that every time, i would be wiped out in two turns due to my horrible luck. something with greater emphasis on thinking rather than chance would be great. i also disliked how every turn was half an hour of waiting for other people to move their troops. i want a long game, but it has to be engaging for everyone, or at least not so boring and long of a wait. :/ 

any help would be greatly appreciated! ^_^<br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>:  the problem is finding games that can involve more than 2 people, but are less luck-based than games such as risk or the similar, though more complex, axis and allies.  you would have to resort to something like trivial pursuit or chinese checkers or else word-based games such as scrabble.  another fun game, also largely luck-based, but not entirely and not dependent on dice is mah jongg, which is similar to the card game, gin rummy and is best suited for 4 players, although as few as 2 can play.  for 2 players, i always liked othello.  nine-men's morris is another.<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: QUESTION:

        <br>i bought an ouija bored from walmart and it wont work why<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>:  people sometimes have better luck when 2 people operate the ouija board.  
you have to believe, you have to concentrate, so clear your mind, think the question in your mind as you ask it, and be sure only one question is presented to the board at a time. 
some people just have no luck with the board, it has been my experience that you have to have some spiritual connection. some people are just not in tunned with spiritual energy.
