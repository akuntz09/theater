            poll :-   cats or dogs ?
        <br>i prefer dogs.......cats are evil !<br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>:  cats are not evil.  all the cats i've had were cuddly &amp; came running to meet me when i got home, &amp; they would stand on their hind feet to have their heads petted. they were good company in the garden &amp; when i was home on sick leave &amp; was sleeping all day.  they liked to sleep on the roof &amp; drape over the roof when i held up a stick or toy for them to grab.  gardening &amp; sleeping were 2 of their favorite things.  also, they came running to get on my lap whenever i got out their little comb &amp; brush.  they were sweethearts &amp; were never aloof like some people say about cats.  maybe it depends on who raises the cats &amp; the expectations of those people.  personally, i expect them to be cuddly &amp; good company, &amp; they've never let me down. <br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>:  both! and turtles. :)
