            mario, sonic, or zelda?
        <br>what game series do you guys prefer? i prefer the legend of zelda games, and i know what most of you will say, but what do you prefer?<br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>:  zelda because it has a more complex story filled with mystery, drama, action, and even romance. the legend of zelda also teaches you things at a psychological level (that's a theory). mario is good adventure/platformer game but the story is a cliche, the typical beautiful girl kidnapped by a monster saved by a hero even the legend of zelda is more complex than that. sonic goes last not very good story and an old game for kids (most people don't like their 3d versions). that's what i think: 1st zelda, 2nd mario, 3rd sonic. <br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: zelda!<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: hates?<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: doubt?<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: no?<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: THE?<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: CREATED?<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: OF?<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: Zelda?<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: ON?<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: sucks?<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: asked?<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: GREATEST?<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: OF?<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: questions?<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: ALL?<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: EARTH?<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: THE?<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: life?<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: beyond?<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: who?<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: Anyone?<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: TIME?<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: GAME?<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: EVER?<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: Absolutely?<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: completely?<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: FACE?<br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: zelda?<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: a?<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: the?<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: at?<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: zelda?<br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: Absolutely<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: beyond<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: a<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: doubt<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: no<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: questions<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: asked<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: the<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: GREATEST<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: GAME<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: OF<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: ALL<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: TIME<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: EVER<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: CREATED<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: ON<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: THE<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: FACE<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: OF<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: THE<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: EARTH<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: Anyone<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: who<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: hates<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: Zelda<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: sucks<br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: at<br><b>ACTOR 3</b>: life<br><b>ACTOR 1</b>: completely<br><br><b>ACTOR 2</b>: Absolutely, beyond a doubt, no questions asked, the GREATEST GAME OF ALL TIME EVER CREATED ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH!

            super mario?
        <br>can someone please tell me the chronological order that the mario games take place in, not by the date they were released<br><br><b>ACTOR 3</b>:  i don't believe there is a comprehensive story for the mario universe -- just different concepts for games.  each individual game has its own story separate from the others, really.  you can possibly plot the games that featured bowser as the main villain in the order they were released (super mario, sm3, sm world, sm 64, et al).  but mostly i don't think the producers at nintendo have any mario "bible" that integrates all his incarnations into a single universe--physical or otherwise.<br><br><b>ACTOR 1</b>:  the mario universe doesn't have a timeline, there were so many different games it would be too hard to keep up with, and the games where they were babies involves time warps and magic and the yoshi games can be put in there too as they involve the mario brothers. and some donkey kong games, and mario kart and super smash bros. and mario tennis, baseball, basketball, golf, and soccer. mario and his friends are a very busy bunch! <br><br>
